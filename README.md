# venona

It all started from [Venona Project](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venona_project). And then the crypto tools just kept evolving... And they still are.

## usage

Attacks are performed mostly "REPL style" using [venona.tools](https://github.com/tolitius/venona/blob/master/src/venona/tools.clj). 
For example a [venona.otp-attack](https://github.com/tolitius/venona/blob/master/src/venona/otp_attack.clj) which is an attack on [One Time Pad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad) where the same key was reused.

```clojure
;; a quick start into fascinating crypto universe:

user=> (use 'venona.otp-attack)
nil
user=> (alpha-numerify-all xord-with-spaces)
```
